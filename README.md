# DOCK Digital Account API

This was a fun challenge to develop an API. The stack choosen for this mission was Express + Firestore(Google Cloud) + TypeScript + Swagger. Time spent was ~16 hours.

## Description

Our mission is to build a new digital Dock account for our customers to use through endpoints, where we will receive requests in a new backend that will manage the accounts and their holders (the owners of the digital accounts).
